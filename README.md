# css-proof-of-concepts
This repo contains some awesome UI designs. They are poof of my understanding of css/sccss/sass concepts


## Css techniques used

This project uses scss with a few awesome techniques such as:

* [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/)
* [7-1 pattern](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5625786-produce-maintainable-css-with-sass/5723581-use-the-7-1-pattern-for-a-manageable-codebase)
* [Clip-path](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/)
* [Responsive Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/)
* Component driven design (`Modular building blocks`, `Held together by the layout of the page`, `Reusable`, `Independant`)
* Dry(`Dont repeat yourself`) css coding
* Maintainable and scalable coding
* Float grid system
* Skewed section design



## Project dependencies

* [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)
